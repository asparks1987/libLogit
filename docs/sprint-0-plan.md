# Sprint 0 Plan

Sprint 0 focuses on preparing the backlog for execution, drafting the shared configuration schema, and sizing the foundational stories.

## Objectives
- Validate the initial configuration contract and capture open questions.
- Ensure P0 issues are broken into ready-to-start tasks with owners placeholders.
- Produce story point estimates to feed the burndown baseline.

## Deliverables
- `docs/configuration.md` (draft structure + open questions).
- `schema/logit.schema.json` (initial JSON Schema stub).
- `docs/issue-backlog.md` updated with grooming notes.
- `docs/sprint-0-plan.md` (this document) tracking estimates.

## Story Breakdown
| Story | Description | SP | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----|-------|
| CFG-01 | Finalize shared configuration schema structure | 5 | Review with stakeholders; update `docs/configuration.md` and schema as feedback arrives. |
| CFG-02 | Document schema usage guide | 3 | Flesh out `docs/configuration.md` with examples and override patterns. |
| PKG-01 | Design Python package layout | 3 | Draft module tree, update backlog with tasks for file moves. |
| PKG-02 | Create packaging checklist | 2 | Note setup metadata needs ahead of restructure. |
| SINK-01 | Define sink abstraction contracts | 3 | Capture interfaces + test strategy outline. |
| SINK-02 | Prepare sample config & docs | 2 | Ensure console/file example ready for Sprint 1 implementation. |

Total Planned SP: **18** (Sprint 0 grooming load).

## Next Actions
1. Schedule schema review meeting (capture feedback in `docs/configuration.md`).
2. Assign story owners and update estimates if scope shifts.
3. Transition ready stories into Sprint 1 backlog during sprint review.
