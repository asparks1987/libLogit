# Architecture Decision Records

This directory will house decision records captured during Sprint 0 and beyond.

## Workflow
1. Create a new ADR using the next incremental number (e.g., `0001-remote-transport.md`).
2. Document context, decision, alternatives, and consequences.
3. Reference ADRs from backlog items and implementation PRs.

Template:
```
# ADR <id>: <title>

- Status: Proposed
- Deciders: <names>
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

## Decision

## Consequences
```
